# IpyMIDI

_Interactive MIDI in Jupyter_

IpyMIDI exposes the Web MIDI interface ([Web MIDI
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API)) to Python
as [Jupyter widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io) via
[WEBMIDI.js](https://webmidijs.org/). Connect your MIDI devices (e.g., keyboards,
controllers, etc.) and start interacting with them in Jupyter!

**Note: this is very much work in progress (nothing much to see yet)!**
